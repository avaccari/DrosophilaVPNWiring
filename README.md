# Synaptic gradients transform object location to action

## Abstract
To survive, animals must convert sensory information into appropriate behaviours. 
Vision is a common sense for locating ethologically relevant stimuli and guiding motor responses. 
How circuitry converts object location in retinal coordinates to movement direction in body coordinates 
remains largely unknown. Here we show through behaviour, physiology, anatomy and connectomics in Drosophila 
that visuomotor transformation occurs by conversion of topographic maps formed by the dendrites of 
feature-detecting visual projection neurons (VPNs) into synaptic weight gradients of VPN outputs onto 
central brain neurons. We demonstrate how this gradient motif transforms the anteroposterior location of a 
visual looming stimulus into the flyâ€™s directional escape. Specifically, we discover that two neurons 
postsynaptic to a looming-responsive VPN type promote opposite takeoff directions. Opposite synaptic weight 
gradients onto these neurons from looming VPNs in different visual field regions convert localized looming 
threats into correctly oriented escapes. For a second looming-responsive VPN type, we demonstrate graded 
responses along the dorsoventral axis. We show that this synaptic gradient motif generalizes across all 20 
primary VPN cell types and most often arises without VPN axon topography. Synaptic gradients may thus be a 
general mechanism for conveying spatial features of sensory information into directed motor outputs.
